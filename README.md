## Synopsis

The following exercise leverages ensemble machine learning techniques to identify 
Ransomware addresses from within a dataset [^1] of bitcoin blockchain transactions. The models
are able to identify whether a given address is ransomware with 90% accuracy, and to identify 
whether it belongs to a specific Ransomware family to within 99% accuracy.  

## Recommendations

We highly recommend that exchanges or authorities interested in identifying ransomware addresses leverage these models (or one similar).  Crypto exchanges can protect their customers, and avoid the cost of ransomware attacks, by identifying ransomware addresses and blocking suspicious transactions within their ecosystem. Investigators can leverage the models to identify perpetrators during the investigation and prosecution of illegal cyber crimes.  

## Ransomware Facts

 Ransomware is a cyber attack vector that started demanding payment in bitcoin starting around 2013 with the emergence of “CryptoLocker”. Ransomware attacks have since become more common.  According to service provider AAG [^2]
Ransomware attacks cost the US healthcare sector an estimated $7.8 billion in downtime alone in 2021
There were over 200 million ransomware attacks across the globe in the first half of 2022   
Ransomware accounted for around 20% of cyber breaches in 2022 

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that allows direct exchange between digital addresses recorded on a blockchain.  Ransomware uses bitcoin to extract ransom because transactions are unregulated, digital, fast, global, irreversible, and anonymous.  However, because bitcoin has a publicly viewable ledger, we can analyze transactions to identify patterns indicating whether a given address or transaction maybe part of a ransomware network.  

## Data Elements

Income:  	Satoshis received by this address within a 24 hour period
Loop:		How many coins were split and routed back via a different path this address
Weight:	Value of all input transactions relative to value of all output transactions 
Count:		Number of input transactions relative to number of output transactions
Length: 	Number of mixing rounds where coins were passed to a newly created address
Neighbors:	N/A

## Summary Findings

We built a random forest model that can identify a ransomware address with over 90% accuracy, and categorize it with 99% accuracy.  Assuming access to data similar to the information provided by Kaggle, the following models can be run as a daily batch process to alert authorities and exchange administrators to the potential of ransomware related activities. 

## Methodology

 ### Data Preparation: 

The dataset was highly imbalanced, with only 2% of the data representing malware.  We took
two independent approaches to remedy this:

 ### Random Under Sampling:  

We combined all of the malware data with a random sample of just 2% of the remaining data set to create a balanced data set of malware and non-malware.  

  ### Near Miss Controlled Under Sampling:  

We used IMBLearn’s Near Miss library to perform controlled under sampling on the dataset.  Near Miss selects samples of non-malware samples with the smallest average distance to the closest malware sample. Because the distances between samples are minimized, the dataset is optimized for machine learning. In our example, Near Miss out performed random under sampling by 12-20%, as measured by cross validated F1 scores.  

 ### Synthetic Data Generation with Smote:

SMOTE results were excluded from this notebook.  We did consider using SMOTE to
generate additional, synthetic training data. However, SMOTE datasets of ~50K samples scored
poorly (F1 ~50%).  When we generated a SMOTE dataset of 2 million samples, we did get 
equivalent results to Near Miss. However, the performance did not justify the processing time 
and cost.  

 ### Model Selection:  

We compare the performance of five classification models: K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic
 Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and ​​HistGradientBoostingClassifier.

 ### Hyper Parameter Selection:

We completed a grid search for HistGradientBoostingClassifier.  We completed a randomized search for Random Forest and XGB to minimize processing time.  We completed separate parameter searches for undersampling and near miss datasets.  


 ### Cross Validation:

Data sets were split 67:33 for training and testing respectively.  Isolating a third of the dataset for testing exposes models that are overfit to training data. 


## Results

### Model Performance:

Random Forest was the highest performing model
Logistic Regression was the lowest scoring model
Near Miss data preparation improved model performance by 12-20%
K Nearest Neighbor benefited the most from Near Miss

## Feature Importance

 We spend some time building cohorts based on highly weighted features as reported by the feature importance of XGBoost and Random Forest.  However, the approach of building cohorts only increased the presence of ransomware by a few percentages points, coming nowhere close to the >90% accuracy of the models.  This is likely due to the wide skew of feature values within each ransomware cohort, which makes individual transactions difficult to analyze.  Instead, we are required to rely on the models as effectively unsupervised.  The following chart is a collection of mean feature values, which were manually tabulated.  While this is chart is not useable, it provides some insight into how the features compare for the top five ransomware variants, and perhaps provides a visualization of how a feature based finger print of each variant may appear to a model.
